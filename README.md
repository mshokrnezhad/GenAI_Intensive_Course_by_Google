I participated in the 5-Day Generative Artificial Inteligence (GenAI) Intensive Course by Google, which was an incredible learning experience. The course, which originally launched in November and was joined by over 140,000 developers, was brought back with updated content, new speakers, and a Kaggle capstone project.

This intensive 5-day online course (March 31 - April 4) provided a deep dive into the fundamentals of GenAI technologies and techniques. Created by Google's ML researchers and engineers, the program offered both theoretical knowledge and practical coding examples that helped me build confidence in tackling GenAI projects.

As part of the course, I had the opportunity to work on a real-world capstone project. The project required completing at least one code lab during the course and then developing a capstone project. This was a great way to build my portfolio and demonstrate my skills. Participants had the chance to compete for prizes including Kaggle certificates, badges, swags, and recognition on Kaggle and Google's social media channels.
